## Deadlock Optimization Guide

### Steam Game Launch Options

To optimize your **Deadlock** gameplay, add the following commands to your launch options in Steam:

| Command          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `+exec autoexec.cfg`          | Executes a cfg file on startup |
| `-dev`           | Skips intro on startup, may cause HUD flicker issues on NVIDIA cards |
| `-fullscreen`    | Forces the game to launch in fullscreen mode |
| `-high`          | Prioritizes the game in system processes |
| `-preload`       | Preloads game assets |
| `-forcenovsync`  | Disables vertical sync |
| `-m_rawinput 1`  | Ensures raw input is used for mouse movements |
| `-console` | 
| `-noassert`| 
|` +@panorama_min_comp_layer_cache_cost_TURNED_OFF 256 `|
| ` -convars_visible_by_default `|




Example of full command line: `-m_rawinput 1 +exec autoexec.cfg -console -noassert +@panorama_min_comp_layer_cache_cost_TURNED_OFF 256 -convars_visible_by_default -fps_max 0 -high -dev -preload -fullscreen `

### Video Configuration

This section explains the purpose and effects of various settings in the `videoconfig.txt` file for **Deadlock** to improve game performance and visual quality:

Other recommended adjustments:
- **Particle Levels**: Reduced for minimal distraction and improved performance.
- **Ragdoll Effects**: Disabled to decrease CPU load.
- **Shadow and Lighting Effects**: Minimized to enhance FPS.

You can download the example [Videoconfig.txt](https://github.com/yourusername/Deadlock-Config-And-Windows-Settings/blob/main/videoconfig.txt). Make sure to check which FPS you are targeting and adjust frame times accordingly. Also, set the correct resolution for your display.

**Tip:** Set the file to read-only to prevent the game from overwriting your settings.

### Autoexec Configuration

The `autoexec.cfg` file pre-loads specific commands to enhance performance and in-game behavior for **Deadlock**:

- Default startup settings.
- Graphical adjustments.

Place this file in your Steam or Origin storage location in the cfg folder. Download it [here](C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deadlock\game\citadel\cfg).

## Windows Settings Guide

### Ultimate Performance Mode in Windows

#### Overview
The Ultimate Performance Mode in Windows optimizes power settings to enhance system performance. This mode is particularly beneficial for **Deadlock** players who require maximum performance from their systems.

#### Activation Command

To activate Ultimate Performance Mode, which is not visible by default in Windows, use the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61
```

After running the command, follow these steps to activate the Ultimate Performance Mode:

    Open Control Panel.
    Navigate to Hardware and Sound > Power Options.
    Under Choose or customize a power plan, select Ultimate Performance.

Improve Internet performance with the right MTU size
Calculating the Optimal MTU Size

To determine the optimal MTU size without packet loss, use the ping command. Start with a high MTU size and adjust as necessary:

bash

ping 8.8.8.8 -f -l 1492

Checking Your Current MTU Size

To view the current MTU size for all network interfaces on your system, use the following command:

bash

netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces

Setting the MTU Size

Once you have identified the optimal MTU size, set it for a specific network interface (e.g., Ethernet) using:

bash

netsh int ipv4 set subinterface "Ethernet" mtu=1500 store=persistent

Make sure to replace "Ethernet" with the actual name of your network interface if it differs. Adjust the MTU values based on the results of your MTU size calculation.

bash

There are additional ways to improve your performance in Windows:
- Disable Game Mode.
- Close unused applications.
- Free up memory and optimize your hard drive and RAM.
- Keep drivers updated.
- Regularly scan for malware.
- Use an SSD for game files.

NVIDIA Guide
New NVIDIA Driver

Download the latest driver here. Make sure to uninstall NVIDIA GeForce Experience beforehand.
NVIDIA Display Settings

Go to the display settings and select the desired resolution and refresh rate. Ensure that your refresh rate is as high as possible (e.g., 360 Hz). If you cannot maintain FPS equal to your monitorâ€™s Hz, consider lowering the refresh rate or capping FPS.

Adjust settings like Digital Vibrance and G-Sync/FreeSync according to your preferences and monitor capabilities.
NVIDIA 3D Settings

Open the Nvidia Control Panel and navigate to 3D settings. Apply the following settings for Deadlock:

    Select 'Custom' settings.
